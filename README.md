Backend and frontend application for a hotel management app.

The technologies I used were Springboot and React and I have made a web application with the following criteria:

• the user specifies a radius in kilometers to find all the nearby hotels
• the application lists and displays all hotels found
• the user can select a specific hotel and see all available rooms alongside their prices
• after this, the user can book one, or more of the available rooms
• the application allows the user to cancel their reservation or change the booked room at least
two hours before the check-in
• user can leave a feedback (services, cleanliness, etc)
